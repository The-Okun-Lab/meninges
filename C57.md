## Overview

This report is designed to visualise the distribution of Tertiary
Lymphatic Structures (TLSs) in mice meninges in multiple ways that
provide insight to different aspects of the data.

## Exploratory statistics

The current analysis includes data on 173 lymphatic structures from 8
mice, belonging to 1 strains, 1 age categories and 1 genders, for a
total of 1 groups ([Table 1](#tbl-stats)).

Table 1: Basic statistics on the TLSs from mice meninges. Size and
length are measured in mm, whereas phenotype and sinus location are
reported in terms of the number of structures per each phenotype or
sinus location, respectively.

[Figure 1](#fig-bar) shows the distribution the TLSs distribute in terms
of their length and size across all tissues.
