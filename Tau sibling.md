## Overview

In this report we profile the meninges of Tau sibling mice in terms of
Tertiary Lymphatic Structures (TLSs). The following chapters provide
insight to different aspects of the TLSs, such as their location,
distribution and density.

## Exploratory statistics

The current analysis includes data on 12 lymphatic structures from 2
mice, belonging to 1 strains, 1 age categories and 1 genders, for a
total of 1 groups ([Table 1](#tbl-stats)).

and length are measured in mm, whereas phenotype and sinus location are

sinus location, respectively.</caption>

Table 1: Basic statistics on the TLSs from mice meninges. Size and
length are measured in mm, whereas phenotype and sinus location are
reported in terms of the number of structures per each phenotype or
sinus location, respectively.

[Figure 1](#fig-bar) shows the distribution the TLSs distribute in terms
of their length and size across all tissues.
