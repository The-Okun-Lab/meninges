# Meninges
This repository contains a workflow to study the distribution of tertiary lymphatic structures around rodent meninges. The full analytical report is available in [this document](https://github.com/RiboRings/meninges/blob/master/meninges_report.md). Different aspects of the data are visualised in multiple ways, which include:

- [Scatter plot](https://github.com/RiboRings/meninges/blob/master/results/plots/fig-loc-1.png)
- [Distribution plot](https://github.com/RiboRings/meninges/blob/master/results/plots/fig-dist-1.png)
- [Distribution plot by phenotype](https://github.com/RiboRings/meninges/blob/master/results/plots/fig-dist-pheno-1.png)
- [Density plot](https://github.com/RiboRings/meninges/blob/master/results/plots/fig-dens-1.png)
- [Density plot by phenotype](https://github.com/RiboRings/meninges/blob/master/results/plots/fig-dens-pheno-1.png)
- [Composite plot](https://github.com/RiboRings/meninges/blob/master/results/plots/fig-loc-dens-1.png)

In the future, data from other groups of participants will be integrated to the analysis.
