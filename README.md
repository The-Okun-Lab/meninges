# Meninges
This repository contains a workflow to study the distribution of tertiary lymphatic structures around rodent meninges. Different aspects of the data are visualised in multiple ways, which include:

- Scatter plots
- Distribution plots
- Density plots
- Composite plots

Currently, results are available for the strains: [APP](https://github.com/RiboRings/meninges/blob/master/APP.md) and [C57](https://github.com/RiboRings/meninges/blob/master/C57.md).
